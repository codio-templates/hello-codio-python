----------

The **Parameterized Assessment** on this page displays the variables used for each parameter, shown with {{var}} syntax, rather than generating the values the students will see.

>Note: to view this question from the student perspective you must first add this Starter Pack to a course (directions [here](https://docs.codio.com/instructors/setupcourses/add-remove-assignment.html#add-remove-assignment)). Then, either view it in 'Preview' mode or as a Test Student.

## Parameterized Question Example

Built using a **Standard Code Test**, the question below randomly selects from two parameters: shape and dimension. It then generates a unique, auto-graded question for each student.

Specifically, the variables that generate randomly for students are:
 - Three possible shapes (rectangle, ellipse, triangle)
 - The function names, images, and area formulas corresponding to those shapes
 - Values between 1-100 for a shape's dimensions
