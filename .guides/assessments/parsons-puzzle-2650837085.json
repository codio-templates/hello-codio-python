There is no list named `pets` so that option can be ignored. The loop that says `for animals in animal:` expects there to be a list named `animal` while `animals` would represent each element in the list. The order is reversed. Don't forget to indent the print statement.\n\n```python\nanimals = [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"fish\", \"rabbit\"]\nfor animal in animals:\n    print(\"Animal #{} is a {}.\".format(animals.index(animal) + 1, animal))\n```",
